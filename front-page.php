	Grandparents are increasingly responsible for rearing their grandchildren. God speaks through
	Scripture to grandparents with the same responsibility of instruction as parents, but in a more
	supporting role. Teaching our children is a personal responsibility. We are not to leave it for
	others to do. Even if grandparents do not have the full responsibility for their grandchildren, they
	can have a major impact on their rearing. Grandparents taking heed of God’s Biblical
	instructions can sow seeds of Godly character that will impact their grandchildren’s lives forever.
	The teaching and training they provide is eternal. According to the promise of Proverbs, a child
	who is diligently trained in the “way he should go” will remain true to that way in this life and
	reap its rewards in the next.

<h2>Our Home Sweet Home</h2>
<p>Our Home Sweet Home is a story about little forest friends who are displaced by a careless forest fire. They have to travel many miles to relocate. One year later, after God’s green earth has started to restore itself, they decided to move back to their homeland. They traveled many days to their old stomping grounds. Once there, they are afraid the fire and winds would come back. Hoot Owl and Woody Woodpecker offer them a plan for security to take away their fear. 
Read the story and find out what the plan was all about.</p>
